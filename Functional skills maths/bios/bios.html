<h2>Andy Parkinson</h2>
<img class = "bio" src="../assets/bios/Andy Avatar.png">
<p>Born in the wild far north of the UK, a childhood spent battling White walkers, Direwolves and the Ironborn led Andy, almost inexporably to a career teaching Maths (Via training as an engineer and working as a chef) .
After teaching Maths to secondary students across Yorkshire for 15 years, Andy decided to leave to seek his fortunes in the private sector and after many years of travelling, ended up at Multiverse where he works in the functional skills team, coaching apprentices through the functional skills component of their apprenticeship while also building content for the maths curriculum.
Outside of work, Andy lives in one of the highest settlements in the UK with his wife and two cats. He enjoys cooking, building patios and competing very badly in triathlons.
All Andy wants for Christmas is a new flat cap.
